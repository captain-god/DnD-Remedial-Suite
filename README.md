D&D 3.5 Remedial Suite
=============

If you've played 3.5 before, you're probably aware of the lengthy process that is creating a character. This is my attempt at remedying this. 

Along the way, I got bold, and started thinking of fun, new things I can include in my project. Such things included a City/Town manager, a world map viewer, an encounter builder, a loot table generator, a spell and item generator, and a few other things. The full list of planned features can be found in the Wiki.
